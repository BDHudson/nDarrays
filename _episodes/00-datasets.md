### Reanalysis datasets:

We will be exploring the xarray architecture using some sample climate data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](http://www.ecmwf.int/)). We will use their ERA-Intrim climate reanalysis project. You can download the data in netcdf format [here](http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim-full-daily/levtype=sfc/). As is the case for many climate products, the process involves downloading large netcdf files to a local machine.

Note: this example follows and expands from xarray developer Stephan Hoyer's [blog post](https://www.continuum.io/content/xray-dask-out-core-labeled-arrays-python).
